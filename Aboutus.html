            <p> EAPC Gatuku CDC is a Compassion-assisted project that works to retrieve children from poverty and bring them them up in a Christian way</p>
            <section class="aboutus">
                
                The compassion has its operations controlled from the main office that is situated in the United States<br>
                while the country's operations are run from the country's main office that is mostly situated in one of the big town of the country.<br>
                An example with ours that is run by the Kenyan head office that is situated in Karen, Nairobi. <br>
                <p> After the main office we have the center's office that now plays the active role of dealing and <br>
                working with the children. As with ours, our center's office is situated in Tharaka Nithi county, Tharaka North Sub-county, Mukothima ward, Makutano village<br>
