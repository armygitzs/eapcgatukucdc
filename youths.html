    At EAPC Gatuku CDC, we have a several youths who are aged from ________ to _________ years. they are majorally in high schools, polytechnics, colleges and universities
    across the country.They are on a average of _________in number.<br>
    While in the project they undertake several tasks. Unlike the rest, whose work is majorly done in classes, tasks done by the youths are mostly covered out of the class.
    This is because their syllabus isn't much defined and again they are out of the project most of their time because their education calendar is quite different from the rest of others.
    But apart from that, there are domains that they occassionally cover; spiritual domain, physical domain, socio-emotional domain and cognitive domain. They also take part in community development projects.
